# Collectiv-Recommender-System

1.) User inputs 17 attributes about himself/herself(city of residence, gender, age, weight, height, etc). 
2.) Said recommender system garners that information, finds k=6 closest people to him/her via a KNN algorithm, and 
    finally recommends items back to the user via interest of k=6 closest matches.

b.) Open the server.py file in a text editor and press Ctrl+B to run the program.
