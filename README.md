# Collectiv-Recommender-System

User inputs 17 attributes about himself/herself(city of residence, gender, age, weight, height, etc). Then, the recommender system garners that information, finds the 6 closest people to that user using a K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm, and then recommends items that those 6 people like back to the user.

In order to run the server, download all of the files into one singular folder. Then, open the server.py file in a text editor and press Ctrl+B to run the program. Thereafter, copy/paste the hyperlink to a browser - the command line should state the hyperlink under "Engine Serving on http://(something)". If the Engine is not working, press Ctrl+S and then press Ctrl+B. If you want to make changes to any file, simply edit the file, Ctrl+S that file in order to save it, and then Ctrl+S the server.py page in order to respawn the server.py page Engine. 

Once you are done with the server, press Ctrl+B again in order to exit out of the engine.
