Rattlesnake Ridge (sometimes called Rattlesnake Ledge or Rattlesnake Mountain) is a mountain ridge located south of North Bend, Washington, United States.A complicated maze of abandoned logging roads and constructed trails have been strung together to provide a 10.5-mile (16.9 km) foot path from the Snoqualmie Point Trailhead at Exit 27 on I-90 all the way to the Rattlesnake Lake trailhead near Exit 32.
