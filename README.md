# Collectiv-Recommender-System

User inputs 17 attributes about himself/herself(city, gender, age, weight, height, etc). Then, the recommender system garners that information, finds the 6 closest people to that user, and recommends those items back to the client. 

In order to run the server, download all of the files in one singular folder. Then, open the server.py file in a text editor and press Ctrl+B to run the program. Thereafter, copy/paste the hyperlink to a browser - the command line should state the hyperlink under "Engine Serving on http://(something)". If the Engine is not working, press Ctrl+S and then press Ctrl+B.

NOTE: Once you are done with the server, press Ctrl+B again in order to exit out of the engine.
